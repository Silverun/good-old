- ! Check lot adding with ref to userId - string
- Add async storage service
- Lots item and list styling
- Check redundant methods in firebase regarding fetching lots (getLots)
- Check locales in createdAt time inside LotItem
- Check locales constant file
-! AddLotForm - images are uploaded even if form fails
- Error handling addNewLot
- RHF cleanup?
- Empty description fails to submit!
- ! Optimization on component, callback, handlers etc
